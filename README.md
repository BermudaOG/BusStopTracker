# Real Time Bus Tracker
## A maps project using static information on NYC bus stops to show a pin moving back and forth between said stops using a push of a button.
## All you have to do is push the buttton on the top left and the pin will cycle through a couple of stops back and forth.
## Additonal improvements would be to add all of the data and have the pin cycle through each route.
