<h1> Real Time Bus Tracker </h1>


A maps project using static information on NYC bus stops to show a pin moving back and forth between said stops using a push of a button.

All you have to do is push the buttton on the top left and the pin will cycle through a couple of stops back and forth.

Additonal improvemnts would be to add all of the data and have the pin cycle through each route.
